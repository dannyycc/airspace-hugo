ABACUSâ€™s first circle of the academic year! Whip out your old white shirts and dust off your ugly school ties you thought you never needed again for a fun night out at the SU! Circling is an expectacular event where everyone sits around in a circle and plays drinking games and then when feeling ready we can move onto the copper rooms.
